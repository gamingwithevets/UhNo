**UH, NO**: <sup>(a clone of)</sup> The World's #1 Card Game!

Okay, it should be obvious as to what card game this game is a clone of. This clone was created with the concept of house rules in mind;
in the future, this clone will have customizable house rules, ~~as well as multiplayer!~~ (no way there will be multiplayer)
This way, you can play with ANY friend who knows how to play UN- I mean, *UH, NO*, and especially prefers playing by their own house rules!

FREEDOM FOR EVERYONE!!!!!!! WOOOOOOOOOO
